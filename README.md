# Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Aylin, and I am a Ph.D. student studying transcriptional regulation and structural biology at the Universidad Nacional AutÃ³noma de MÃ©xico. I hold a Master's degree in Biochemistry from the same university, and I also have a background in Pharmaceutical Chemistry.

I am passionate about both wet and dry lab work, and I love exploring the intersection between these two areas. My research focuses on understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate gene expression, and I use a variety of experimental and computational techniques to achieve this goal.

When I'm not in the lab, I enjoy hiking, playing guitar, and watching movies. I'm also known for my terrible puns and dad jokes, so feel free to hit me up if you need a laugh!

## Current Projects

- [Project 1](https://github.com/yourusername/project1](https://github.com/aylindmm/A.mexicanum.git): A study of axolotlÂ´s rgeneration process.

## Skills

- Molecular biology techniques (e.g. PCR, cloning, gene expression analysis)
- Computational modeling and simulation (e.g. molecular dynamics)
- Programming (R)
- Data analysis and visualization

## Contact Me ðŸ“« 

Feel free to reach out to me via email at aylindmm@gmail.com. I'd love to hear from you!

## Joke ðŸ‘€

Why don't scientists trust atoms? 

Because they make up everything! ðŸ˜‚
